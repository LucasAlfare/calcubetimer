	-test out security! how to deal with infinite loops, or sucking up of system resources?

TODO:

for release:
-worsttime in dynamic string is broken, it should ignore infinite times, worstTimeOfCurrentAverage should also properly format POP or DNF
-clean up all critical TODOs scattered throughout the code
	-fix stackmat inspection when the stackmat gets turned off
-internationalization (dates, too)
	http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/intro/index.html
	http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Internationalization/how2I18n.html
-open source sourceforge!
-create license, give credit where credit is due
-deside upon default startup layout (should we remove the progress time stuff from the default layout?)
-update FAQ, defaults.properties file, about.html
-create small diagnostic problem that will dump relevant info to a file (java
	version, os, etc.)
-write scramble plugin tutorial

misc:
-java webstart? applet?
-dynamic string multiple argument format
-BUG: titled borders are not anti-aliased (substance bug!)

cleanup:
-generalize XML syntax (get rid of Dynamic... classes) UPDATE: no idea how to do this...???

Server stuff:
-overhaul to get rid of threads
-latency on server - this is so that clients don't flood the server with too many time messages
-urgent hint for waiting messages on server? nonexistent in java as of 1.6
