	http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/intro/index.html
	http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Internationalization/how2I18n.html
-clean up all critical TODOs scattered throughout the code
-open source sourceforge!
-update FAQ, defaults.properties file, about.html
-create license, give credit where credit is due
-send modified sunday contest to jon morris
-create small diagnostic problem that will dump relevant info to a file (java
	version, os, etc.)

scramble stuff:
-write scramble plugin tutorial
-icons on scramble choices?

misc:
-expand jtable of times to include {current, rolling1, rolling2} average column
-java webstart? applet?
-dynamic string multiple argument format

cleanup:
-generalize XML syntax (get rid of Dynamic... classes) UPDATE: no idea how to do this...???
-integrate statsdialoghandler with ui xml stuff

Server stuff:
-latency on server - this is so that clients don't flood the server with too many time messages
-urgent hint for waiting messages on server? nonexistent in java as of 1.6
